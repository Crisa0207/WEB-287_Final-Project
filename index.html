        Hello! My name is Cristal Esperanza and I am an aspiring UX designer currently pursuing an Associate’s in Web & UX Design at Wake Technical Community College. Technology has always fascinated me & as I learn more about UX design each day, my passion for creating user-centered products only grows stronger. My goal is to help users feel appreciated and understood when they interact with a website, app, or product feature. I believe that design should always put the needs and wants of the user first, and I’m committed to making that a reality. As I look towards the future, my career goal is to secure an internship where I can further develop my design skills and gain real-world experience. I’m excited to continue on this journey toward becoming a professional and successful UX designer, and I look forward to working with companies and individuals who share my passion for user-centered design.
